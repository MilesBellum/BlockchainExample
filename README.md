# Android Blockchain Example
This mobile app is an example to learn how Blockchain works as an Android app using Java.


Getting started
---------------
You can clone or download this repo and use it for free. If there are build errors, in Android Studio go to `Tools -> Android -> SDK Manager` and install any available updates. Then go to `Build -> Clean Project` and finally `Build -> Rebuild Project`.
Remember, this project runs with AndroidX and new Material Design. So you will need getting the last API version and updates (`targetSdkVersion 28`).
